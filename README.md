# Image Schema Repository 

This repository contains examples of image schemas from literature that were initially collected in <a href="http://zope.psyergo.uni-wuerzburg.de/iscat">ISCAT</a>, 
an Image Schema Database procured by JÃ¶rn Hurtienne, and in the <a href="https://metaphor.icsi.berkeley.edu/pub/en/index.php/Category:Metaphor">MetaNet Metaphor Wiki in English</a>. 
Furthermore, additional examples from literature not covered in the two resources were included. Source references is provided in the CSV file presented the data and 
the full source information is contained in the references.txt file. 

The examples from all resources were formatted consistently, annotated with standardized, deduplicated concceptual metaphors and image-schematic structures, where there is a distinction between 
spatial primitives and image schemas.
